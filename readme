## An example repo illustrating how to use pymc to fit a  
    model for galaxy surface brightness to observations of M31. ##

Contains:

 - m31_SB_profile.txt (our observations)
 - SB_model.py (defining the pymc statistical model)
 - MCMC_surface_brightness.ipynb (a notebook that guides you through the fitting procedure)
 - MCMC_surface_brightness.py (a pure python version of the above, if you don't have the notebook)


TO RUN THE NOTEBOOK:
simply run, from this folder:
$ ipython notebook MCMC_surface_brightness.ipynb

TO RUN THE PYTHON FILE:
I recommend running the python file one command at a time,
 to see how it works, though you can run it from the command line:
$ python MCMC_surface_brightness.py
